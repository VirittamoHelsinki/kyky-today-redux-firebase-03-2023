This file lists some missing features in the Job Calendar section of the app.

Currently the entire calendar solely relies on localStorage to work, this should be changed to use the database instead. --------DONE
This should go without saying, but any bugs that are found should be ironed out!

Job Calendar:
  - Confirmation modal does not exist:
    When confirming pending jobs, there should be a modal to confirm the action.
    Currently, there's not even a way to confirm jobs, ADD THIS!
  - Pending jobs are not differentiated from confirmed jobs:
    Pending jobs should be listed and have a confirmation button.
  - Move job select input to header:
    It is currently at the middle of the page.

  Refer to the figma of the job calendar for more details.

Settings:
  - Export/Import does nothing:
    The export/import buttons do nothing.
    They should export/import the data to/from a file.
  - Settings are not actually used by the app:
    They are saved to localStorage, but the app does not use them.

Needs overhauling:
Jobs are saved as a json file called "jobs.json".
This shouldn't be the case! Instead user should be able to add jobs from the app itself. -------------DONE
Jobs should be stored in the database and then used from there. --------------------------------------DONE

Once the jobs.json file is removed and replaced with the database, an alert should be shown in the app to the user if they have not yet added any jobs.

These are probably not all of the issues, but these are the most glaring ones. Refer to the figma design and compare it with the app to see what's missing.
